## Quick background research (for context & citations)

* **Who is Fabled Sky (FabledSky.com)?**
  Fabled Sky Research describes itself as a research & technology organization founded out of an activist lineage. Its “About” page traces roots to the **BTLF Group** (founded by two UCLA students in 2009), with early work focused on anti‑censorship and human‑rights hacktivism before evolving into Fabled Sky Research in 2021. ([Fabled Sky Research][1])

* **AIO (Artificial Intelligence Optimization) standards:**
  Fabled Sky maintains the **AIO Standards Framework (v1.2.7)** as an open, non‑commercial, model‑agnostic standard for structuring content so LLMs can retrieve and trust it. Module 1 explicitly frames AIO as **neutral and non‑commercial**, distinct from SEO/GEO, and aligned with open data/open science. ([aio.fabledsky.com][2])
  Module 5 formalizes **licensing & governance** (MIT license) and states that governance is **neutral, non‑commercial, and consensus‑driven**—and importantly, it clarifies: **“Fabled Sky does not sell AIO services.”** ([aio.fabledsky.com][3])

* **Objectivity AI:**
  Fabled Sky’s Objectivity AI page presents it as a post‑human, research‑grade LLM approach that is **in active development and not yet commercially available**, with an alpha‑trials sign‑up and an emphasis on transparency. ([Fabled Sky Research][4])

* **Volunteer & community ethos:**
  Fabled Sky’s CSR page explicitly encourages **employee volunteering and community service**, providing a natural home for community projects that are pro‑bono/public‑interest oriented. ([Fabled Sky Research][5])

## Draft: Fabled Sky Community Projects — **XAIO.org**

> **Tagline (suggested):**
> *Volunteer‑built. Standards‑first. Open by design.*

### What “Community Projects” mean at Fabled Sky

Fabled Sky Community Projects are **passion projects** incubated by Fabled Sky employees and supported by a high‑signal volunteer network. They are **pro bono** by intent: Fabled Sky may contribute essential infrastructure (e.g., domain, hosting, and light ops), but **most of the legwork is contributed by volunteers and employees on their own time**. Projects must be **non‑profit in spirit and public‑benefit in outcome**—and they exist to serve society before any commercial interest.

This DNA traces back to our **BTLF‑era mission**—open access, radical transparency, and the foundational rights of the internet. Today, that ethos lives on in how we choose, design, and steward community projects. ([Fabled Sky Research][1])

### Introducing **XAIO.org**

**XAIO.org** is the official platform for **Objectivity AI–validated, AIO‑standardized generative research**. It exists to make **factual, transparent, and machine‑verifiable knowledge** easy to access, cite, and build upon.

**Why XAIO.org (and not a Fabled Sky subdomain)?**
Although Fabled Sky developed both the **AIO framework** and **Objectivity AI**, XAIO.org is intentionally **separate** to avoid even the appearance that it is a marketing vehicle. AIO is a **neutral, non‑commercial standard**; Fabled Sky **does not sell AIO services**, and the standard is stewarded as open public infrastructure. XAIO.org reinforces that separation and independence. ([aio.fabledsky.com][2])

**Status:**

* **Closed beta** (foundational build‑out).
* **Public submissions** will open later, with Objectivity‑AI validation required for inclusion.

### What XAIO.org will do

**1) Index factual, verifiable reports—with a focus on geopolitics.**
Geopolitics is uniquely vulnerable to misinformation and influence operations. XAIO.org prioritizes **event‑level facts** and **verifiable claims**, especially where on‑the‑ground documentation (citizen journalism) complements institutional coverage.

**2) Welcome a broad contributor base.**
Influencers, domain experts, local witnesses, and citizen journalists are all in scope—**follower count is not a prerequisite for trust**. Transparency is. Contributors must **disclose funding, affiliations, and potential conflicts** clearly and proactively.

**3) Require Objectivity AI validation and AIO compliance.**
All public reports must pass **Objectivity AI** validation and conform to **AIO** structure before being cached as generative outputs. Objectivity AI enforces **source‑grounding, cross‑corroboration, and transparent evidence labeling**; AIO ensures **machine‑readability and retrievability** for LLMs and search. (Objectivity AI is an active development initiative, with transparency commitments published; XAIO.org uses a research‑grade configuration.) ([Fabled Sky Research][4])

**4) Publish clean, fast, and distraction‑free.**
XAIO.org will remain **ad‑free**, **newsletter‑free**, and **noise‑free**—a lightweight interface devoted to facts, provenance, and updates.

### How validation works (high‑level)

1. **Submission** → Report, claim set, or event brief is submitted.
2. **Pre‑screen** → Basic eligibility (scope, format, safety/ethics), spam/fraud checks.
3. **Objectivity AI pass** →

   * Cross‑source verification (thresholds for consensus and confidence).
   * Evidence labeling (e.g., *verified fact*, *widely reported claim*, *contested*, *minority perspective*).
   * Explanation trace and citation depth.
   * Internal consistency checks and bias‑stress tests.
     *(Validated using **GPT‑5 Pro** with Objectivity AI embedded—formerly “O3 Pro” in internal workflows.)*
4. **AIO compliance pass** →

   * Proper document scaffolding (titles, claims, evidence blocks).
   * Authorship & provenance metadata.
   * Versioning, timestamping, and update policy.
5. **Cache & publish** →

   * The final artifact is **AIO‑conformant** and **LLM‑addressable**, cached for reliable retrieval by LLMs, search engines, and downstream tools.

### Contributor Guidelines (draft checklist)

To protect integrity—and to make your work maximally reusable by people and machines—submissions should include:

* **What happened, where, when**: time, location, and participants; include raw media if you have it.
* **Primary evidence** (links/media), plus **independent corroboration**; label any unverified items.
* **Authorship & affiliations**: real name or accountable handle, **sponsorship disclosures**, funding, and any **conflicts of interest**.
* **Methodology notes**: how information was gathered, and known limitations.
* **Fact vs. analysis**: clearly separate observation from inference or opinion.
* **Provenance**: original file metadata (when safe), chain‑of‑custody, and edit history.
* **Updates & corrections**: commit to iterative updates as new facts emerge.
* **AIO structure**: headings, claims/evidence blocks, citations, and machine‑readable metadata.

Consistency matters: continued inclusion on XAIO.org depends on a **track record of accurate, transparent submissions**.

---

### Independence, governance, and non‑commercial stance

* **AIO is neutral public infrastructure**. It is versioned and community‑reviewable; governance is **consensus‑driven and non‑commercial** under Fabled Sky’s stewardship. **Fabled Sky does not sell AIO services.** ([aio.fabledsky.com][3])
* **Objectivity AI** has a published **transparency posture** and is **not a commercial product at present**; XAIO.org uses it in a **research‑grade** capacity for validation. ([Fabled Sky Research][4])
* **Community‑built**: Projects are **volunteer‑driven** (employees & public contributors); Fabled Sky offers **basic infrastructure and safety/quality oversight**, consistent with its CSR emphasis on **volunteering and community engagement**. ([Fabled Sky Research][5])

---

### What makes XAIO.org different

* **Standards‑first**: Everything is published in **AIO format** so models can faithfully retrieve, attribute, and reason over the material (not just humans skimming a page). ([aio.fabledsky.com][2])
* **Evidence‑labeled**: Outputs carry transparent evidence classes and citation depth; absence of evidence is labeled as such (no confident claims without support).
* **No engagement bait**: No ads, no funnels, no trackers that distort incentives—just verifiable information.
* **Designed for the public good**: The bar for inclusion is **societal benefit**, not brand visibility.

---

### Scope and roadmap

* **Phase 1 (current)**: Closed platform build‑out; curation of high‑signal sources; initial validator pipelines; internal contributor onboarding.
* **Phase 2**: **Public submissions** open with **clear contributor guidelines** and Objectivity‑AI‑gated publication.
* **Phase 3**: Public APIs for **cached, AIO‑structured generative outputs**; programmatic access for LLMs, search, and knowledge graphs.

---

### How to participate

* **Volunteer** your skills (research, moderation, data pipelines, AIO formatting).
* **Contribute** factual briefs or event reports (once public submissions open).
* **Audit**: Help test Objectivity AI validation behaviors and AIO conformance on sample reports.
* **Sponsor infrastructure** (non‑editorial): bandwidth, archiving, and mirroring.

> **Note on brand separation:**
> XAIO.org exists to **prevent** conflation between Fabled Sky’s research pedigree and project independence. Even though Fabled Sky authored the AIO framework and the Objectivity AI approach, XAIO.org is **not a marketing initiative**; it’s a **public‑benefit, standards‑driven platform**. ([aio.fabledsky.com][2])
